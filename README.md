# Spew
Domain Specific Language for installing files and various interpreters \
Currently WIP, and only PySpew is being actively developed

## Project is currently 'dangerous'
What I mean by that is that it does not have any security features to stop execution of dangerous code. \
It's still being implemented, and down here you can find what was implemented and what is WIP.
