# Spew
Domain Specific Language for installing files and various interpreters \
Currently WIP, and only PySpew is being actively developed

## Project is currently 'dangerous'
What I mean by that is that it does not have any security features to stop execution of dangerous code. \
It's still being implemented, and down here you can find what was implemented and what is WIP.

## Some information I must add
As I speak two languages, English and Portuguese, I find myself various times writing code in both, accidentally. Maybe that is because I'm so focused I do not even acknowledge in what language I'm writing in print statements. \
Most of the time, those are commit messages and debugging texts. I'm extra careful in Specifications because its text-writing and not code-writing.
